And this page is just informational. **Read more at https://dublin-traceroute.net** .

Dublin Traceroute has a blog, with articles on how to make the best out of it. Check it out at [blog.dublin-traceroute.net](https://blog.dublin-traceroute.net).

Dublin Traceroute has also Python bindings, that will let you:
* use Dublin Traceroute from Python code
* generate graphical visualizations of your multipath traceroutes
* do statistical analysis using Pandas

See [python-dublin-traceroute](https://github.com/insomniacslk/python-dublin-traceroute) for more information.

But, in a few words, you can run traceroutes in multi-path networks (i.e. with ECMP load-balancing enabled), recognize NATs, have nice diagrams like the one below, export to JSON, and do this with a command-line tool, a C++ library or a Python library.
